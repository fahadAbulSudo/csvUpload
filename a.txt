# CSV File Upload and List Web Application

This is a web application for uploading, processing, and listing CSV files with real-time feedback and caching for optimal performance.

## Features

### Functional Features

- **Upload CSV Files**: Users can upload CSV files through the web interface.
- **List Uploaded CSV Files**: View a list of all uploaded CSV files.
- **View CSV Data**: Open and view the content of the uploaded CSV files.
- **Search CSV Data**: Search through CSV file content for specific data.
- **Delete Uploaded CSV Files**: Remove uploaded CSV files and associated data.
- **Describe CSV Columns**: Users can select a column from the CSV file and add descriptive information about what that column represents (e.g., column purpose, data format).
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive instant feedback about upload success or failure through Socket.IO.

### Non-Functional Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: CSV files are processed in the background using a queuing system with Bull, ensuring that large files do not slow down the application.
- **Caching**: Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., file lists, column headers) to improve performance and reduce database load.
- **Scalability**: The queuing system allows the application to handle large volumes of CSV files without impacting overall performance.
- **Socket.IO for Real-Time Updates**: Users receive real-time updates and feedback during file uploads and processing.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling ensures smooth user experience even when something goes wrong.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd csv-file-upload-list
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following values:

   ```env
   DATABASE=your_mongodb_database
   SECRETKEY1=your_secret_key
   ```

### 4. Start the Application

You need to run both the web server and the background worker for CSV processing.

- **Start the Web Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

- **Start the Worker Process:**

   ```bash
   node workers/csvWorker.js
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Upload CSV files using the file upload form.
3. View the uploaded files and perform searches within them.
4. Select a column and describe it with additional information (e.g., what the column represents, expected data format).
5. Receive real-time feedback on the status of your file uploads.
